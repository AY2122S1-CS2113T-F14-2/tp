5. Type `java -jar FitBot.jar` into the command prompt and press enter to start the program.

If successfully loaded, you will see this logo:

![Untitled](./images/StartupLogo.png)

## 2. Create Profile

_Fitbot_ will detect if there is a profile present in the application. If you have not set up a profile,
_Fitbot_ will ask you for your particulars.


Particulars required include name, height, weight, age, gender, calorie goal and activity factor. The application will prompt for your particulars again if your input is incorrect.

After setting up the profile, you can start recording your food and exercises with the commands below.


## 3. Terminology

**_Calorie_** - A unit used to measure the energy of an item. One calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. On average, a male will require approximately 2500 cal while a
female will require around 2000 cal per day.\
\
***Calorie goal*** - The amount of calorie you wish to consume per day. In our application, calorie goal is defined as the
total calorie intake from all the food consumed per day.

***Net Calorie*** - The difference between calorie
goal and the total calorie burnt from exercising and [body metabolism](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Metabolism.aspx).
For your information, we use [basal metabolic rate (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) to compute
the rate of calorie consumed by body metabolic activity.\
\
***Activity factor*** - A coefficient or value used in the calculation of BMR to measure the level of activity. In our application, we use an integer ranged from 1 to 5 to measure the activity factor:
Little to no exercise (0-1 day of exercises a week)
Lightly active (1-3 days of exercises a week)
Moderately active (3-5 days of exercises a week)
Very active (6-7 days of exercises a week)
Extremely active (when sports is your passion and have a very physical job scope)
\
\
***Body Mass Index (BMI)*** - A measure to evaluate if the body weight is healthy. BMI is computed by using the body
weight(in kg) divided by the square of the body height(in m). \
\
***Item*** - We use the term **item** to represent the item that can be stored in our application. The available item
include **Food** and **exercise** only.\
\
***Upcoming exercise*** - We define the exercise with date after today's date as an upcoming exercise. This kind of exercise
will be handled specifically. It will not be added to the exercise list but will be saved internally in the storage file. More
details of the process can be found at [here](#add-a-recurring-exercise-to-the-upcoming-exercise-list).\
\
***Item Bank*** - An item storage that is capable to store the Food or exercise Item with its respective calorie. This is
to help you to store the calorie intake of a specific Food or the calorie burnt from a specific exercise for future use. More details
of the item bank can be found at [here](#add-a-food-item-to-foodbank).\
\
***Parameters*** - Parameters are values in the command format that _Fitbot_ expects you to provide.


## 4. Features

‚ÑπÔ∏è ***Command Format***

- Commands are not case-sensitive (e.g. `help`, `HELP`,`hElP` are all able to execute the `help` command)

- Words in upper case (e.g. `UPPER_CASE`) are used to signify parameters.

- Parameters in curly brackets `{}` are optional.

  e.g. `bmi {h/HEIGHT_IN_CM w/WEIGHT_IN_KG}` can be `bmi` or `bmi h/150 w/70`

- The order of the parameters do not matter.

  e.g. `add f/potato c/200` or `add c/200 f/potato` both adds a Food Item called "potato" with 200 calories.


‚ùó Please do not use the characters `/` and `|` in your input other than to specify parameters!

### 4.1 **View help:** `help`

This command shows a list of commands recognised by _Fitbot_ and their usage.

Format: `help`


### 4.2 View and edit your profile details: `profile`

#### 4.2.1 View Profile
Typing `profile` lets you view your name, height, weight, gender, age, calorie goal and activity factor.

Example:

```text
profile 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Hello Lisa! This is your profile: 
*====================================== 
	Name                Lisa 
	Height              159cm 
	Weight              50.0kg 
	Gender              F 
	Age                 21 
	Calories goal       1500 cal 
	Activity factor     2 
======================================* 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
```  

#### 4.2.2 Updating your profile attributes:

Changing your attributes require at least one of these input parameters:
\
`profile {n/NAME} {h/HEIGHT} {w/WEIGHT} {s/GENDER} {a/AGE} {g/CALORIE_GOAL} {x/ACTIVITY_FACTOR}`
\
where:
\
`n/`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name
\
`h/`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; height (cm)
\
`w/`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weight (kg)
\
`a/`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age
\
`g/`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calorie goal
\
`s/`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gender (M/F)
\
`x/`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activity factor (1: Sedentary - 5: Extra Active)



### 4.3. Calculate BMI: `bmi`

This command calculates your BMI value based on the height and weight values you provide.

It also displays the weight status *(underweight, healthy, overweight, obese)* based on calculated BMI.


Format: `bmi h/HEIGHT_IN_CM w/WEIGHT_IN_KG`

‚ùó `HEIGHT_IN_CM` and `WEIGHT_IN_KG` must be positive numbers.
\
üí° **Tip:** If you do not provide the values, the BMI will be computed based on your current height and weight as indicated in your profile.



Example:

- `bmi` calculates the BMI value based on your height and weight in your profile.
- `bmi h/170 w/65` calculates the BMI value based on height 170cm and weight 65cm.

```text  
bmi
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Your BMI value according to your current profile is:
	15.5 (Underweight)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

bmi h/170 w/65  
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
The calculated BMI value is 20.1 (Healthy)
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
```  


### 4.4. Add Items: `add`

This command adds an Item to a list.

#### 4.4.1. Add a Food Item to Food List

This command is used to add a Food Item consumed within the past 7 days to the Food List.

Format: `add f/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY} {t/HHMM}` adds a Food Item consumed with its respective calories on the given
date (`DD-MM-YYYY`) and time (`HHMM`).

Example:
- `add f/chicken rice c/607 d/21-10-2021 t/1400` adds record of food consumed: chicken rice with 607 calories gained on 21 Oct 2021 1400 to the food list.

```text

__________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added:
    chicken rice (607 cal) @ 14:00, 21 Oct 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
```
üí°  **Tip:** If you do not specify the date and time of the Food Item, it is assumed that the date and time is based on the date and time of input.


#### 4.4.2. Add an Exercise Item to Exercise List

Format: `add e/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY}` adds an Exercise Item with its respective calories burnt on the given date (`DD-MM-YYYY`). 

‚ÑπÔ∏è If `DD-MM-YYYY` is in the future, the Upcoming Exercise Item will be added to the Upcoming Exercise List instead.

Example:
- `add e/hiit c/290 d/21-10-2021` adds record of exercise done: hiit with 290 calories burnt on 21 Oct 2021 to the exercise list.
```text
add e/hiit c/290 d/ d/21-10-2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise has been added:

__________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item for the future has been added:
    hiit (290 cal)
```


üí°  **Tip:** Similarly, if the date of the exercise is not provided, the date is assumed to be today.

#### 4.4.3. Add a Recurring Exercise to the Upcoming Exercise List

This command is used to schedule exercises that you do on a regular basis. This can be particularly useful if you have weekly trainings to record!
\
Format: `add r/ITEM c/CALORIES :/START_DATE -/END_DATE @/DAY_OF_THE_WEEK` adds recurring exercise with its respective calories burnt to the upcoming list.\
‚ùó `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` must be in the future.\
‚ùó `START_DATE` must be before `END_DATE`.\
‚ùó `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` must follow `DD-MM-YYYY` format.
