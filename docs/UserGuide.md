## 1. Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.  If not, install Java 11 [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of [Fitbot.jar](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F14-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.0) from the cloud.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your _Fitbot_.
4. Go to command prompt and change the directory to the file's location. [Not sure how to do this?](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/)
5. Type `java -jar FitBot.jar` into the command prompt and press enter to start the program.

If successfully loaded, you will see this logo:

![Start Up Screen](./images/StartupLogo.png)

## 2. Create Profile

_Fitbot_ will detect if there is a profile present in the application. If you have not set up a profile,
_Fitbot_ will ask you for your particulars.


Particulars required include name, height, weight, age, gender, calorie goal and activity factor. The application will prompt for your particulars again if your input is incorrect.

After setting up the profile, you can start recording your food and exercises with the commands below.


## 3. Terminology

**_Calorie_** - A unit used to measure the energy of an item. One calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. On average, a male will require approximately 2500 cal while a
female will require around 2000 cal per day.\
\
***Calorie goal*** - The amount of calorie you wish to consume per day. In our application, calorie goal is defined as the
total calorie intake from all the food consumed per day.

***Net Calorie*** - The difference between calorie
goal and the total calorie burnt from exercising and [body metabolism](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Metabolism.aspx).
For your information, we use [basal metabolic rate (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) to compute
the rate of calorie consumed by body metabolic activity.\
\
***Activity factor*** - A coefficient or value used in the calculation of BMR to measure the level of activity. In our application, we use an integer ranged from 1 to 5 to measure the activity factor:
Little to no exercise (0-1 day of exercises a week)
Lightly active (1-3 days of exercises a week)
Moderately active (3-5 days of exercises a week)
Very active (6-7 days of exercises a week)
Extremely active (when sports is your passion and have a very physical job scope)
\
\
***Body Mass Index (BMI)*** - A measure to evaluate if the body weight is healthy. BMI is computed by using the body
weight(in kg) divided by the square of the body height(in m). \
\
***Item*** - We use the term **item** to represent the item that can be stored in our application. The available item
include **Food** and **exercise** only.\
\
***Upcoming exercise*** - We define the exercise with date after today's date as an upcoming exercise. This kind of exercise
will be handled specifically. It will not be added to the exercise list but will be saved internally in the storage file. More
details of the process can be found at [here](#add-a-recurring-exercise-to-the-upcoming-exercise-list).\
\
***Item Bank*** - An item storage that is capable to store the Food or exercise Item with its respective calorie. This is
to help you to store the calorie intake of a specific Food or the calorie burnt from a specific exercise for future use. More details
of the item bank can be found at [here](#add-a-food-item-to-foodbank).\
\
***Parameters*** - Parameters are values in the command format that _Fitbot_ expects you to provide.


## 4. Features

‚ÑπÔ∏è ***Command Format***

- Commands are not case-sensitive (e.g. `help`, `HELP`,`hElP` are all able to execute the `help` command)

- Words in upper case (e.g. `UPPER_CASE`) are used to signify parameters.

- Parameters in curly brackets `{}` are optional.

  e.g. `bmi {h/HEIGHT_IN_CM w/WEIGHT_IN_KG}` can be `bmi` or `bmi h/150 w/70`

- The order of the parameters do not matter.

  e.g. `add f/potato c/200` or `add c/200 f/potato` both adds a Food Item called "potato" with 200 calories.


‚ùó Please do not use the characters `/` and `|` in your input other than to specify parameters!

### 4.1 Customizing your profile:

You can customize your profile with the following steps.

#### 4.1.1 Setting up your profile

Refer to [2. Set Up Profile](#2-set-up-profile) to set up your profile.

#### 4.1.2 Viewing profile: `profile`

Typing `profile` lets you view your name, height, weight, gender, age, calorie goal and activity factor.

Example:

```text
profile 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Hello hi! This is your profile: 
*====================================== 
	Name 				Lisa 
	Height 				159cm 
	Weight 				50.0kg 
	Gender 				F 
	Age 				21 
	Calories goal 		1500 cal 
	Activity factor 	2 
======================================* 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
```
#### 4.1.3 Updating profile attributes 

Change your profile attributes with the following command: \
`profile {n/NAME} {h/HEIGHT} {w/WEIGHT} {s/GENDER} {a/AGE} {g/CALORIE_GOAL} {x/ACTIVITY_FACTOR}` \
\
where : \
\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; height in cm \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight in kg \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calorie goal \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gender (M or F) \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activity factor (1: Sedentary - 5: Extremely Active)

where you will require at least 1 of the optional parameters (in no particular order) to change your attribute!



### 4.2 Recording your food consumption

You can record all the food items consumed within a week into the food list. This allows you
to keep track of your food calorie consumption and gain a better understanding of your diet habit. 

#### 4.2.1 Adding Food Items `add f/`

This command allows you to add a new Food Item to the Food List.

Format: `add f/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY} {t/HHMM}` adds a Food Item consumed with its respective calories on the given
date (`DD-MM-YYYY`) and time (`HHMM`).

Example: 
- `add f/chicken rice c/607 d/21-10-2021 t/1400` adds record of food consumed: chicken rice with 607 calories gained on 21 Oct 2021 1400 to the food list.

```text
add f/chicken rice c/607 d/21-10-2021 t/1400
__________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added:
    chicken rice (607 cal) @ 14:00, 21 Oct 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
```
üí° **Tip:** If you do not specify the date and time of the Food Item, it is assumed that the date and time is based on the date and time of input.

üí° **Tip:** It is possible to add Food Item without providing the calorie of it. You can do this by saving the corresponding 
Food Item into the Food Bank. More details can be found at [Section 4.5](#45-building-your-food-bank).

‚ùó The input date `DD-MM-YYYY` must within 7 days before today. For example, if today date is `20-10-2021`, then the input
date must be within `13-10-2021` to `20-10-2021`.

#### 4.2.2 Viewing Food List `view f/`

You may want to view how many calories you have taken in this week. This command will show a list of Food Items and 
their calories added within 7 days (including today) from the list.

Format: `view f/`

Example: 

```text
view f/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Here is a summary of all the food items you have consumed in the past week:
..........................................................................................................
You have consumed 3 food item(s) on Friday (22 Oct 2021):

..........................................................................................................
Total number of food consumed in this week: 7
Total calories consumed in this week: 3425 cal
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.2.3 Deleting Food Items `delete f/`

When you mistakenly add a wrong Food Item inside your Food List, there is no need to worry! The command allows you to 
remove a specific Food Item in the Food List.

Format: `delete f/LIST_NO. d/DD-MM-YYYY t/HHMM` deletes the *n<sup>th</sup>* Food Item in the Food List which has the date (`DD-MM-YYYY`)
and time (`HHMM`), where *n* is the index of the Food to delete.

‚ùó `LIST_NO.` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:

```text
delete f/1 d/22-10-2021 t/1000
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been deleted:
	donut x2 (607 cal) @ 10:00, 22 Oct 2021
Number of food item(s) left: 6
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```
üí°  **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Food Items from the list, there is a shortcut command: `delete f/all`.
```
delete f/all
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All food items have been removed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

### 4.3 Recording your exercises

Besides Food Items, you may also record Exercises that you have taken into the Exercise List. This will allow you to keep
track of total calories burnt and check whether you have done sufficient exercises. 

#### 4.3.1 Adding Exercise Items `add e/`(Tip: exercise bank, upcoming exercise)

By using this command, you can add any Exercise Items done into the Exercise List.

Format: `add e/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY}` adds an Exercise Item with its respective calories burnt on the given date
(`DD-MM-YYYY`).

‚ÑπÔ∏è If the date `DD-MM-YYYY` provided is in the future, this exercise will be treated as an Upcoming Exercise Item, 
and it will be added to the [Upcoming Exercise List](#441-adding-upcoming-exercise-items-add-e) instead.

üí° **Tip:** Similar to [Food Item](#421-adding-food-items-add-f), if you do not specify the date and time of the Exercise Item, 
it is assumed that the date and time is based on the date and time of input.

üí° **Tip:** It is possible to add Exercise Item without providing the calorie burnt on it. You can do this by saving the corresponding
Exercise Item into the Exercise Bank. More details can be found at [here](#46-building-your-exercise-bank).

‚ùó The input date `DD-MM-YYYY` must within 7 days before today. For example, if today date is `20-10-2021`, then the input
date must be within `13-10-2021` to `20-10-2021`.

Example:
- `add e/hiit c/290 d/21-10-2021` adds record of exercise done: hiit with 290 calories burnt on 21 Oct 2021 to the exercise list.

```text
add e/hiit c/290 d/ d/21-10-2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise has been added:
    hiit (290 cal) @ 21 Oct 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.3.2 Viewing Exercise Items `view e/` `view u/`

It is possible to view and check all the exercises you have added. This command is for you to view all the exercises taken
