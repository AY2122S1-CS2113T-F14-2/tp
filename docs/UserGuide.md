## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your computer.  If not, install Java 11 [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version of [Fitbot.jar](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F14-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.0) from the cloud.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your *FitBot*.
4. Go to command prompt and change the directory to the file's location.
5. Type `java -jar FitBot_v1.0.jar` into the command prompt and press enter to start the program.

If successfully loaded, you will see this screen:

## **Terminology**

**_Calorie_** - A unit used to measure the energy of an item. One calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. On average, a male will require approximately 2500 cal while a
female will require around 2000 cal per day.\
\
***Calorie goal*** - The amount of calorie you wish to consume per day. In our application, calorie goal is defined as the
total calorie intake from all the food consumed per day. In addition, net calorie will mean the difference between calorie 
goal and the total calorie burnt from exercising and [body metabolism](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Metabolism.aspx). 
For your information, we use [basal metabolic rate (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) to compute 
the rate of calorie consumed by body metabolic activity.\
\
***Activity factor*** - A coefficient or value used in the calculation of BMR to measure the level of activity. In our 
application, we use an integer ranged from 1 to 5 to measure the activity factor, with 1 being sedentary (little or
no exercise) and 5 being very active in playing sports and exercising. \
\
***Body Mass Index (BMI)*** - A measure to evaluate if the body weight is healthy. BMI is computed by using the body 
weight(in kg) divided by the square of the body height(in m). \
\
***Item*** - We use the term **item** to represent the item that can be stored in our application. The available item 
include **food** and **exercise** only.\
\
***Upcoming exercise*** - We define the exercise with date after today's date as an upcoming exercise. This kind of exercise 
will be handled specifically. It will not be added to the exercise list but will be saved internally in the storage file. More 
details of the process can be found at [here](linkToAddFutureExerciseOrDG).\
\
***Item Bank*** - An item storage that is capable to store the food or exercise item with its respective calorie. This is 
to help the user to memorize the calorie intake of a specific food or the calorie burnt of a specific exercise. More details 
of the item bank can be found at [here](linkToAddBank).


## **Features**

‚ÑπÔ∏è  ***Command Format***

- Commands are not case sensitive (e.g. `help`, `HELP`,`hElP` are all able to execute the `help` command)
- Words in upper case (e.g. `UPPER_CASE`) are known as parameters; values to be provided by users
- Parameters in square brackets are optional.

  e.g. `bmi [h/HEIGHT_IN_CM w/WEIGHT_IN_KG]`  can be `bmi` or `bmi h/150 w/70`

- The order of the parameters do not matter.

  e.g. `add f/potato c/200` or `add c/200 f/potato` both adds a food item called "potato" with 200 calories.


‚ùó Please do not use the characters `/` and `|` in your input!
