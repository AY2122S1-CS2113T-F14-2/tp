‚ÑπÔ∏è ***Command Format***

- Commands are not case sensitive (e.g. `help`, `HELP`,`hElP` are all able to execute the `help` command)
- Words in upper case (e.g. `UPPER_CASE`) are known as parameters; values to be provided by users
- Parameters in square brackets are optional.

  e.g. `bmi [h/HEIGHT_IN_CM w/WEIGHT_IN_KG]` can be `bmi` or `bmi h/150 w/70`

- The order of the parameters do not matter.

  e.g. `add f/potato c/200` or `add c/200 f/potato` both adds a food item called "potato" with 200 calories.
