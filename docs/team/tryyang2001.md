### **Summary of Contributions**
Below are all the contributions done by the author to Fitbot.

#### **New Feature**: Add Food Item
- What it does: This feature allows users to add a new food item to the food list, together with the calorie of the food item,
  and the date and time when consuming the food.
- Justification: This feature is one of the core feature in Fitbot application. It can help the users to keep track of the 
  food calorie taken. With all the food items stored in a list, this feature enables calculation of total calorie, and the number
  of suppers taken. 
- Highlights: This feature adds a food item to the food list, and ensures that the food items are sorted according to their date 
  time. 

#### **New Feature**: View Food Item
- What it does: This feature allows users to view all the food items he or she added. In addition to that, it also shows the total 
  food item consumed for each date and time period in the week. Moreover, it also shows the total calorie consumed 
  for each day and also in the week.
- Justification: This feature allows users to check their food list, so that they can do some operations such as `add` and `delete` 
  whenever necessary.
- Highlights: This feature will show a list of food consumed by the users within 7 days of today. The food items are separated with 
  different date and time period, covered with nice frames.

#### **New Feature**: Delete Food Item
- What it does: This feature allows users to delete unwanted food items. 
- Justification: Whenever the user adds a wrong food item or makes a typo, he or she may want to delete it. This feature allows the permanent deletion of
  food item.
- Highlights: This feature will delete the food item specified by the user. It will first check if the food item with the item index, date and time given
  by the user are correct and existing, then delete the corresponding food item. This feature also supports clearing the food list when the users want to 
  have a new food list.
